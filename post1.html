    Just by visiting this page you command your cpu to run my code.<br>
    If you thought my code was unsafe or posed danger - you'd not visit, right?<br>
    But you're here, without knowing whether I'm a nice guy or not, because you trust that your browser's security measures would protect you.<br>
    Now imagine if I also wrote your browser? And purposefully made it vulnerable to disclosing your private information? And would be able to collect and sell it? Or blackmail you?<br>
    'Funny', you'd think.. But imagine now reading such a thing posted by Google? Hm?<br>
    Obviously, it is posted by them, away from the public eye, somewhere within internal papers. Not only posted, but successfully implemented.<br>
    <br>
    Let's undo their hard work, shall we?<br>
    <br>
    This article doesn't aim to be accurate or complete, but it does aim to be useful.<br>
    <br>

    <p2>So what is 'data'?</p2><br><br>

    When did you access the website? What pages did you access? When did you access those pages? How much time have you spent on them?<br>
    <br>
    Answers to those seemingly innocent questions allow mildly evil people to understand your interests and grab your attention, which enables them to advertise 'relevant' things to you.<br>
    Just evil people can use that information to essentially doxx you.<br>
    Very evil ones however can build an inescapable, invisible prison, where every action of yours would be known and you'd be judged for it.<br>
    <br>
    Contrary to popular belief the third hasn't happened yet, and we can keep it that way.<br>
    <br>

    <p3>Here, let's look at an example request for a tracking pixel:</p3><br>
    <br>

    Imagine you're casually browsing your favorite forum, clicking on threads, images, etc.. Every act of clicking loads a web page. The web page includes
    an invisible image in an img tag.
    <br>
    This image's src points to a malicious server that logs the details of the request. A request like this one:
    <br>

    <pre><code>
      GET /track.gif?user_id=123&amp;session=98&amp;thread=1337&amp;timestamp=1670001234 HTTP/1.1
      Host: trackingserver.com
      User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
      Referer: https://forum.com/thread/1337
      Accept: image/webp,image/apng,image/*,*/*;q=0.8
      Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
      Cookie: track_id=abcd123
    </pre></code>

    This line containing GET parameters:
    <pre><code>
      user_id=123&amp;session=98&amp;thread=1337&amp;timestamp=1670001234
    </pre></code>
    <br>
    This is 'data'. This is exactly what enables tracking. Imagine if somebody had a log of those things - your entire browsing history plus some data analytics?
    <br>
    Well, chances are, somebody already does. Huge, scary attack vector.
    <br>
    <br>

    How would the hostile server look, anyways?<br>
    <pre><code>
      const express = require('express')
      const app = express()
      const PORT = 3000

      app.get('/', (req, res) => { // our page with interesting content
          res.send(`
              &lt;html&gt;
                  &lt;body&gt;
                      &lt;h1&gt;Tracking pixel demo&lt;/h1&gt;
                      &lt;img src="/track.gif" alt="tracking pixel" /&gt; // innocent-looking image tag
                  &lt;/body&gt;
              &lt;/html&gt;
          `)
      })

      app.get('/track.gif', (req, res) => { // here we serve the malicious gif

        doEvilThings(req.query) // req has user_id, session id, current page, thread id, time, etc..

        // 1x1 pixel gif
        const pixel = Buffer.from([
            0x47, 0x49, 0x46, 0x38, 0x39, 0x61, 0x01, 0x00,
            0x01, 0x00, 0x80, 0xff, 0x00, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff,
            0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
            0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x02, 0x44,
            0x01, 0x00, 0x3b
        ])

        res.writeHead(200, { // metadata so that it's displayed
            'Content-Type': 'image/gif',
            'Content-Length': pixel.length
        })

        res.end(pixel) // send the thing.
      })

      app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running at http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`))
    </pre></code>

    Obviously google's implementation is a little more sophisticated than this, but not by much.<br>
    <br>
    Easy and effective, right? Why not host this right now and include it on your website? Huh, you don't have a website?<br>
    What about emails? They support html, and the img tag, yeah?<br>
    That's exactly what pretty much every company does nowadays, and having 'Show images' enabled in the email client is privacy suicide.<br>

    <br>

    There's one more interesting line in the request above however:<br>
    <pre><code>
          Cookie: track_id=abcd123
    </code></pre>
    
    Of course evil pixels aren't the only way to do evil things, why would they be?

    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>Cookies</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Cookies do a lot of very useful things, like remembering your sessions so that you don't have to enter your password every 2 minutes,<br>
    or storing your settings so that the website's light theme doesn't flashbang you on every page refresh.<br>
    <br>

    They essentially provide a way to persistently store client-side session data, which begs the question:<br>
    What if they generate a universally unique id for every user, and then store that in a cookie?<br>
    Harmless, until it's read by the same server across different websites with the intention of assembling the user's browsing history.<br>
    <br>
    'How though?'
    <br>
    <br>
    Say, you're browsing this website, let's call it Website A:

    <pre><code>
      const express = require('express')
      const app = express()
      const PORT = 3000

      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
          res.send(`
              &lt;html&gt;
                  &lt;body&gt;
                      &lt;h1&gt;This is Website A&lt;/h1&gt;
                      &lt;script src="http://localhost:5000/set-cookie.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; // Note that it refers to a different port
                  &lt;/body&gt;
              &lt;/html&gt;
          `)
      })

      app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Website A running at http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`))
    </pre></code>
      
    And this would be Website B, the malicious server:

    <pre><code>
      const express = require('express')
      const app = express()
      const PORT = 5000

      app.get('/set-cookie.js', (req, res) => {
          res.set('Content-Type', 'application/javascript')
          res.send(`
              document.cookie = "thirdPartyCookie=123; SameSite=None"
              console.log("Third-party cookie set by Website B")
          `)
      })

      app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Website B running at http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`))
    </pre></code>


    Notice this line, specifically the SameSite=None attribute
    <pre><code>
      document.cookie = "thirdPartyCookie=123; SameSite=None"
    </pre></code>

    What this does, it makes the cookie available to the domains that didn't set it, i.e. it can be sent to any server ever.<br>
    Luckily it's not 2008, and browsers have evolved to block such a thing, either through CORS policy, or with explicit anti-tracking cookie rules.
    <br>
    Sounds very reassuring, though guess what happens if the website calls the tracking api on the backend now instead of the frontend? Well, you get tracked.<br>
    This requires more friction from the website and tracker devs to implement, but money wins, as per usual.<br>
    <br>
    And who suffers from that? Of course, the user. Did 'privacy' laws like GDPR improve actual user privacy? You can press F12, open cookies tab and see for yourself.<br>
    They did successfully accomplish, however, making the web even more polluted, with the 'Cookie consent' questions/notifications that waste users' time. Brave blocks those.<br>

    <br>
    <p2>Supercookies</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Normal cookies are kind of annoying when used maliciously, but at the very least they are easy to block or delete.<br>
    Welcome 'Supercookies'. They are not really cookies, just some javascript that writes metadata to the headers/local storage/other different places.<br> 
    <br>

    Let's look at this example request.

    <pre><code>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: image/jpeg
      ETag: "a3d9-58ca7e4c"
      Content-Length: 41401
    </pre></code>
    
    The etag field is usually used for caching. Instead of sending, for example, an image multiple times, it's sent once, saved in browser cache (just files on the disk),<br>
    and then the identifying etag is sent instead. Identifying, huh?<br>

    <pre><code>
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1>Etag tracking demo&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;img src="/track.gif" alt="tracking image"&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre></code>

    And our server:

    <pre><code>
      const express = require('express')
      const app = express()
      const PORT = 3000

      app.get('/track.gif', (req, res) => { // This time the gif itself isn't malicious

        let etag = req.header('If-None-Match') // If user already has an etag, it would be here

        if (!etag) {
          // This is the first time this user has visited, assign them a new etag
          etag = '' + Math.random() // We are using a random number, but in the real world it would be some UUID
        }

        // 1x1 transparent gif, this time we don't care about displaying it
        res.type('gif')
        res.send(Buffer.from('R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'base64')
      })

      app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running at http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`))
    </pre></code>

    Looks pretty harmless, no? How exactly would this track somebody?<br>
    As mentioned previously, the etagged content is cached, meaning stored in a file on the disk, which means it's implemented lower, closer to protocol-level.<br>
    It'll be available for the server to read regardless of sessions or incognito mode. Some browsers (Brave) will automatically isolate/clear the cache, but it's safest to clear it manually. <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p2>Fingerprinting</p2>
    <br>
    <br>

    There are other ways to recognize somebody through sessions/incognito mode/vpns.<br>
    
    There's always something unique about your setup. Screen resolution? Browser/Os version? Extensions and their html byproducts even.<br>

    <br>
    Look at this:

    <pre><code>
      function generateFingerprint() {
          const navigatorData = {
              userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
              language: navigator.language,
              platform: navigator.platform,
              deviceMemory: navigator.deviceMemory || 'unknown',
              hardwareConcurrency: navigator.hardwareConcurrency,
          }

          const screenData = {
              width: screen.width,
              height: screen.height,
              colorDepth: screen.colorDepth,
              pixelDepth: screen.pixelDepth,
          }

          const json = JSON.stringify({ navigatorData, screenData })
          return json
      }
  </pre></code>

  <div id='fingerprint'></div>
  <button style='margin-left:50px;font-size: 30px;' onclick='fingerprintAndShow()'>Fingerprint me!</button><br><br>

  This would then be hashed and saved, and used to recognize you every time you visit.<br>
  <br>
  
  It also can be done with a canvas:
  
  <pre><code>
    function canvasFingerprint() {
      const canvas = document.getElementById('canvasFingerprint')
      const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
      
      // Random text (the exact appearance will be different on different machines)
      ctx.textBaseline = "top"
      ctx.font = "14px 'Arial'"
      ctx.textBaseline = "alphabetic"
      ctx.fillStyle = "#f60"
      ctx.fillRect(125,1,62,20)
      ctx.fillStyle = "#069"
      ctx.fillText("CANVAS_FINGERPRINT_DEMO", 2, 15)
      ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(102, 204, 0, 0.7)"
      ctx.fillText("CANVAS_FINGERPRINT_DEMO", 4, 17)
      
      const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL()
      const fp = dataURL.replace("data:image/png;base64,", "")
      
      return fp
    }
  </pre></code>

  <canvas id="canvasFingerprint" style="display: none;"></canvas>
  <div id='canvasFingerprintRes'></div>
  <button style='margin-left:50px;font-size: 30px;' onclick='canvasFingerprintAndShow()'>Fingerprint me with canvas!</button>
  <br>
  <br>
  The way this works is we draw random stuff on the canvas, and then save it as an image. An image can be represented as a base64 string.<br>
  Since no machine/setup is the same, this long-ass string will be different (and most probably unique) for every user.<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p2>Other examples</p2>
  <br>
  <br>

  <span style='color:#FFCC66;'>UTM params</span> - things like this:

  <pre><code>
    https://www.example.com/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_term=beach+accessories&utm_content=banner_ad
  </pre></code>

  Those parameters tell that the user reached the website through a Facebook (utm_source) ad (utm_medium) that was part of the "summer_sale" campaign (utm_campaign),<br>
  specifically targeting "beach accessories" (utm_term), and the user clicked on a "banner ad" (utm_content).<br>
  <br>
  Stuff like this can be also sent in emails, so instead of clicking buttons inside, it's best to copy the source link and clean it.<br>
  Some websites (like YT) also sneakily add those params with a script every time you ctrl-c the url, so be careful what you send to others.<br>

  <br>
  <span style='color:#FFCC66;'>Social media plugins</span> - things like disqus.<br>
  Not much new to say here - you load the script, script sets the cookie, cookie gets sent back home.<br>

  <br>
  <span style='color:#FFCC66;'>Heatmaps</span> - things like google analytics.<br>
  Same story, some websites load a script that monitors your cursor's x,y coords and determines where you click and how much.<br>
  This then gets sent home and compiled into a nice visual heatmap.<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p2>So how not to be a multibillion-dollar corp's product?</p2>
  <br>
  <br>

  1. Don't log in to things. Especially into google services.<br>
    If you need gmail - use an email client. If you need YT - search for what you need without using recommendations. If google docs - log in with incognito, do your work and leave.<br>
    Replace malicious services with open-source/reputable ones. Like Protonmail instead of Gmail, Telegram instead of Messenger and NewPipe client instead of the standard YT client.<br>
  <br>

  2. Minimize social media usage. Don't doomscroll, don't click on ads, comment/like/dislike as little as possible.<br>
  <br>

  3. Use an open-source browser with good reputation, like Brave or Firefox ESP.<br>
  <br>

  3. Use Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin. PB recognizes patterns and blocks malicious requests. UBO blocks web garbage, including ads, malicious scripts and tracker loaders.<br>
  Don't use adblock or adblock plus. It's developed by evil people and has a notion of 'acceptable ads'. As Louis Rossmann puts it, "acceptable means they're accepting ad money into their pocket".<br>
  In situations where your privacy is of critical concern - use NoScript.<br>
  <br>

  4. If you use a popular or downright suspicious website - use a vpn with good reputation like Proton or Mullvad (or create your own on a Linode VPS).<br>
  Never ever ever use something like NordVPN and friends. If you do - you're owned for good.<br>
  <br>

  5. Don't use Microsoft Windows. If you do - you're compromised. OSX does collect your data, but there's a much lower chance that the whole world will have access to it.<br>
    In an ideal world though - use Linux.<br>
    Freedom/prison situation? Use Tails.<br>
  <br>

  6. Same goes for mobile devices - Apple products are better than stock Android ones, but an Android device with GrapheneOS or LineageOS is the bulletproof option.<br>
  Never ever use stock Android.<br>
  <br>

  7. If you DO HAVE to use compromising products (like stock Android) - choose the ones that call home to a different country than yours. <br>
  E.g. you live in the US? Buy a Xiaomi that reports back to China. You live in Russia? Buy an iPhone that reports back to the US. You get the point.<br>

  <br>
  <span style='color:#FFCC66;'>Good luck.</span>
